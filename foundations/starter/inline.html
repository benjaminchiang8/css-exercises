    <p style="color: white;">testing teating</p>
    <p style="color: white;">none of the css is in the head of the html document. everything is in the body. this is great for one off modifications, but not really used. Learning CSS. External CSS is good to apply styling to all pages via one central source. Internal is good to apply it to one page and sets the styling in the head and applies to all w/in the page. Inline is good for one off an only gets changed in the body and the specific command</p>
    <p>no style here so no actual changes and nothing shows white</p>
    <p style="background-color: red; color: blue;">the above has some words, but since no style was applied it stayed black despite using the p element - highlight it with your mouse to see</p>
