  <h1> tutorials - the class is h1 as defined by CSS in the head. The color is read. The padding on the left is 60 pixels - like indentation</h1>
  <p>this is our paragraph. the background color was defined as blue - this used P</p>
  this line is using the universal selector and shows the color as green and overrides the other elements that were not defined.  
  <p>this is an example of using internal css, where the CSS is embedded in the head portion of the page. This is advantageous because it doesn't require creating a separate CSS file, but adding the code can cause the page to take extra time to load</p>
  <div>brown brown using div element brown, supercedes universal selector</div>
